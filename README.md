# return_exchange_cycle_detector
This project detects potential fraud in product return and exchange patterns by modeling transactions as a graph. It uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to efficiently detect cycles that may indicate suspicious activity. The system helps in identifying misuse of the return process in e-commerce platforms like Flipkart.
